**Update your row when something lands. Takes ten seconds.**

This is not project-management theatre. Each of you has a separate Claude
session that cannot see the others. When Raghav's Claude reads this file it
learns that `store.py` is real and what shape it landed in, instead of guessing
or rebuilding it. That is the whole point.

## Blockers right now

| Blocker | Who it stops | Workaround in place | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bedrock not authorised** (AWS account flag, support case 178898467100367) | anything invoking a model | none needed yet, Day 1 work has no model calls | Ali |
| Collaborators not invited | Kartik, Alakshendra, Raghav cannot clone | — | Ali |
| `test_virtual_clock_compresses_a_statutory_week` fails 5/5 | anyone reading a red suite as their own breakage | none — see note below | Raghav / Ali |

**On that failing clock test** (found 10 Sep by Alakshendra, not fixed — not my
lane). It is the test that is wrong, not `core/clock.py`. At `scale=86400` the
~20 microseconds between the two `now()` calls advances virtual time about 1.7
seconds, so `(deadline - clock.now()).days` truncates 6d 23h 59m 58s down to 6
and the `== 7` assertion fails. It is not intermittent on this machine; it fails
every time. Comparing whole seconds rather than `.days` fixes it. Flagging
rather than editing, because `tests/test_contract.py` is Ali's and
`core/clock.py` is Raghav's — but until one of you takes it, everyone else sees
a red suite and has to work out it is not theirs.

## Decisions log

Append here when something is settled, so nobody relitigates it at 2am.

- **10 Sep** — Storage goes through `core.db`, never `core.store` directly. Backend is `PANCHAYAT_BACKEND`.
- **10 Sep** — Everyone develops against the in-memory backend. Same tests must pass on both.
- **10 Sep** — Agent stack versions pinned. Raise in group before bumping.
- **10 Sep** — Branch protection is a git hook, not a GitHub ruleset (not enforced on private free-plan repos).
- **10 Sep** — `agents/remedy.load_table()` skips `*.sample.yaml`. The sample duplicates two segments and adds a garbage entry that is out of scope, and a real filing must never go out backed by scaffolding. `ward12.sample.yaml` is now safe to delete whenever Kartik and Raghav confirm nothing local still loads it — the loader already ignores it either way.
- **10 Sep** — `ward12-9thmain` is curated into the real table because `core.fakes.the_outage()` uses it as the decoy. The fixture keeps working after the sample file goes.
- **10 Sep** — The jurisdiction table is **water only**, per the Day 1 brief: one ward deep beats five wards shallow. A garbage or pothole complaint therefore resolves to nothing and the Remedy Agent says so and asks. That is the designed answer, not a gap — `eval/routing_accuracy.py` scores declining as correct.
- **10 Sep** — The table deliberately answers three different authorities. If every segment answered BWSSB, a stub returning the string would score 100% on the routing gate.
